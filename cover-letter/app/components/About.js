    <h3>2006</h3>
    <h2>Started kitchen work</h2>
    <p>
      I started working in kitchens at the age of 18. I worked at a local
      restaurant in my hometown of Surrey, British Columbia.

    <h3>2020</h3>
    <h2>Child Care</h2>
    <p>
     I lost my job due to the pandemic and decided to take a break from managing kitchens.
     I took up a job as a caretaker for high risk youth in my hometown. In my spare time I started
     learning to code.

    <h3>2023</h3>
    <h2>Graduated from Lighthouse Labs</h2>
    <p>
    I ended up loving coding and decided to pursue it as a career. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and graduated from the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. It was challenging, but also extremely rewarding. I learned so much and feel confident in my abilities as a developer. I am excited to see where this career path takes me and am grateful for the opportunity to pursue my passion.

      <p>When I'm not working on coding projects, I love to spend my free time doing things that make me happy. I enjoy taking my dog Bobbi for walks and playing guitar with my friends. Watching movies is also something that I enjoy doing, especially on lazy weekends. Although I used to love cooking, I realized that it wasn't the right career path for me. It's important to follow your passions and find what truly makes you happy.</p>
